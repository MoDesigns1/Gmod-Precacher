# Garrys Mod Model Precacher

Basic addon that precaches vehicle models on your server on STARTUP. This will most definitely increase startup time, however it is worth it!

Have you noticed significant lag when players spawn in vehicles, whether that be using VCMOD, or even the Q menu? This is due to models being loaded there and then, instead we can just precache these models and save our servers.

Add this into your addons folder, but make sure to add a root directory then the lua files.

For example: precacher_addon/lua/autorun/server/config.lua

I uploaded this because I couldn't find anything when I had this issue previously.
